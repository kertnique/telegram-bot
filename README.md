# telegram-bot

I have created a Telegram bot for playing 'Hangman' in English language.
# Gameplay
To create new game, one of the players uses command /create. \n
After that, bot gives unique game id, the other player needs to input like this: /join [ID] \n
Then, player 1 launches game with /begin [word] \n
After finishing the game, players swap roles.
